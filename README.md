# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a web-based tool for visualizing how different sorting algorithms work. It is built using ReactJS and allows users to see the step-by-step process of how the algorithms sort an array of numbers.

[https://algorithm-visualizer-b7h9.onrender.com/](https://algorithm-visualizer-b7h9.onrender.com/)

## Features

- Visualize the sorting process for several different algorithms, including bubble sort, selection sort, and merge sort
- Customize the size of the array and the speed of the visualization
<!-- - View the code for each sorting algorithm in the application -->
